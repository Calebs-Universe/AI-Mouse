Here’s a polished, engaging, and practical README for your **AI Mouse** project:

---

# 🖐️ AI Mouse

**Control your computer with just your finger!**
A fun Python app using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to turn your index finger into a mouse and simple finger gestures into clicks.

---

## ✍️ Features

* 👆 **Move your mouse cursor** with your raised index finger
* 🖱️ **Left-click** using a two-finger gesture (index + middle finger)
* 🔄 **Smooth, real-time gesture tracking**
* 🎥 Demo available to instantly show how it works

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
   ```

3. Save the code as `ai_mouse.py` and run:

   ```bash
   python ai_mouse.py
   ```

4. Make sure your PowerPoint (or any app) is in slideshow mode
   and allow Python to control your mouse (check system permissions)

## 🤖 How It Works

| Component           | Description                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenCV**          | Captures webcam video frames                  |
| **MediaPipe Hands** | Detects hand landmarks                        |
| **Gesture Logic**   | Checks finger positions to determine gestures |
| **PyAutoGUI**       | Moves the system cursor and simulates clicks  |

---

## 📚 Use Case: Presentation Control

Simply open your slides, start the script, and use gestures instead of a clicker:

* 🖐️ Index finger alone → Move cursor (highlight things)
* ✌️ Index + middle → Left-click → Advance slide

---

## 🎥 Demo

*(Insert GIF or screenshot showing gesture → action)*

---

## 🚀 Ideas for Extension

* Enable **right-click** with another gesture (e.g., index + ring finger)
* Add gesture cooldown or soak time for more reliable clicks
* Make the cursor movement **smoother** (e.g., add smoothing filters)
* Add a **UI overlay** to show current gesture status
* Add **voice-tagged gestures** for multimodal control
* Pack it into a service to run at startup

---

## 🧩 Why It’s Cool

This project shows how **computer vision and simple Python libraries** can create a **touchless interface** — just like big tech demos, but built by you. It’s hands-on, engaging, and also a real-world application of input/output devices.
